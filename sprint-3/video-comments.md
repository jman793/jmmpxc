I will participate in the april 15th meeting for the Evolution group. 

Video Comments 
I very much enjoyed the format of the meetings; specifically sticking to strict minutes to keep the agenda moving forward.
For example they went over various pull requests first one of which being about a new metric involving New Contributors. 
They then talked about moving the Risk meeting to April 20th. Then a metric discussing inactive contributors was brought up. 
Then an issue contributor metric was discussed, and specifically talked about the formatting of that proposal. They then posted a template for Evolution metrics. Then Issues and pull requests were discussed. Specifically for the metrics discussed early. Discussed changing the inactive contributors language in the metric description. Lastly a code length metric was discussed and its language was debated over.

I plan on working in the Evolution working group. 

Jonah Marz podcast reflections

I enjoyed listening to the podcast, specifically these few things.

I enjoyed hearing about the origin stories of how everybody got involved. Especially the story of “the one person on the project who does not have a PHD”. 
I loved hearing about how open the project is to new people and new ideas, and how they said how they need people from all walks of computer science. 
I enjoyed listening to the different conversations surrounding how they came up with ideas for metrics. 
I liked hearing how there was dispute on who named the project
I enjoyed them talking about cats

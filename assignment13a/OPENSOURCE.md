The first article talks about intrinsic versus extrisic motivations, and talks about what that means in terms of open source. 
It is an interesting perspective to say that some developers go for open source project in order to increase their own value.
There are moral questions to be answered here which the article goes into.
I agree with the author that sometimes altruism is not always a viable reason for these projects and that some people do them for selfish reasons. 
I am curious as to who that moral burden falls upon. Surely the developer is not at fault for making software that can be used by all for free. 
Open source developers are essentially donating their time to make the software world a better place. 

The second article more goes into how these projects are managed, and how to contribute to an open source proejct. 
I think resources like this are very important because one thing I always personally struggled with was knowing how to contribute.
I always felt like I knew where to find projects, but not how to make any sort of meaningful contribution to them.
I also feel like it is interesting to read about how coperations contribute to these projects and the resources they put into them. 

I would participate in open source software in order to create a better portfolio for myself, and get myself on the map to companies.
I also think that I would be doing the industry a service because I would essentially be donating my time for these projects in order to contribute. 
On the other hand maybe people do programming as sort of a hobby and make their contributions strictly for fun, and really dont have any other things in mind.

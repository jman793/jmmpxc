For the ssoexample.py instead of doing a basic hello world login for an imaginary account I decided to make a login for accounts regarding Google and Github. 
These open source SSO projects have uses when it comes to making it easy so that users dont have to rememebr their login info for random websites they visit. 
This uses an example for the login to github and google.
This does not run on a standalone project they would need to be ran from some sort of website with the github api
For the google project you would need to set up a web app on google cloud platform in order to use Oauth for the website

This file is more meant to be used for example boilerplate more so than an actual functioning app.

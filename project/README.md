Here you will find the code for the app I am buidling for the last two sprints. For right now my end goal is to have an app that allows users to input JSON data which saves to a Database which then can be displayed on a display page. All of this data is going to be tied to user's account obviously there will likely be technical limitations on this (one problem I can forsee is if somebody puts too many json elements to load then it will cause the page to look funny) All of this will be done using angular firebase and SSO will be used to handle the login.  

From here down is after the initial commit

First commit

This commit adds in basic google sign in functionality. In all senses the SSO part of the project is completed. At this point I want to add the logout before the due date on 5/10, but nevertheless Other than logout and the JSON display the project is done. After the logout is done the rest will be by the 18th

I had lots of hardship trying to get this project to work. For one thing the screen to get the Google Oauth credentials made me apply for some sort of consent form which would take too much time to get approved to even make Oauth credentials.
I was able to get the example app to compile and run it just doesnt do anything. I assume that it does not work because of the Oauth issues I had, but I have no idea on how to fix these issues. 

After looking into these issues further I was able to get the app to run after a few changes to the instructions given on the video/website. First of all I had to actually start the process of applying for a consent form and give the product a name. The other issue I had was that my machine is weird about setting environment variables, so I had to set them manually in the python app.py file. I understand this is not a good practice in a real environment, but I figured since this is just for a limited time project that it will not create an issue since this only works locally.

Other than those things I was able to run the code fairly smoothy and was able to sign into any of my google accouts and see the information that the page was supposed to display such as my profile picture and email address.
